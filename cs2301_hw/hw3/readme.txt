This program contains code which duplicates many built in C string functions, 
as well as the framework for an employee structure. 

Note: As I had already completed a very similar assignment as part of my attempt
at CS2303, much of the code is borrowed from my own prior work, which can be
found at github.com/josepher44/cs2303. I have gone over the code closely to
ensure it works and I still understand it, as well as change minor differences
between assignments. I believe I have caught all key differences, but some
residual extra behaviours may remain in place.
